## Machine Learning Engineering Best Practices

I am a core developer and maintainer of the [machine learning engineering best practices catalog](https://se-ml.github.io/practices/), which gathers a set of engineering best practices for developing software systems with machine learning components.

Read more about it on the [project's website](https://se-ml.github.io/practices/) and in the [awesome list](/project/seml/).
