## Adversarial Training and Testing

I developed and maintain a collection of scripts for experimenting with adversarial training and testing on computer vision.
The [project](https://github.com/NullConvergence/CIFAR_ADV) is centred around the CIFAR dataset, but can easily be extended to other datasets by replacing the dataset in the [cifar_data.py](https://github.com/NullConvergence/CIFAR_ADV/blob/master/cifar_data.py) script.

A [mirror](https://github.com/NullConvergence/TINY_IMAGENET) for the tiny-imagenet dataset exists, but it is not always up-to-date.

The project has multiple adversarial training scripts (e.g., for fast or free adversarial training) and integrates well with multiple frameworks (e.g., Weights&Biases for logging or the foolbox library for adversarial ML).

Currently, I push new scripts publicly, after validating them in a private fork of the repo.
