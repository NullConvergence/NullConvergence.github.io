## PyElastic Infrastructure

[PyElastic Infrastructure](https://github.com/NullConvergence/py-elasticinfrastructure) is a collection of scripts for gathering infrastructure metrics and index them in Elasticsearch.
I used this project to monitor the infrastructure of machine learning experiments (e.g., temperature, CPU usage).

The project integrates with the [mtorch]() experiment management template.
