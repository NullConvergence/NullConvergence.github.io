## Tutorial on Adversarial Examples

I developed a Jupyter Notebook [tutorial on adversarial examples](https://github.com/NullConvergence/tutorial_adversarialml) (also called evasion attacks) for security oriented folks or students.
The tutorial was presented at several academic venues.

It assumes close to no knowledge of machine learning and it is meant to provide a steady introduction to the security of machine learning, with a focus on adversarial examples.
