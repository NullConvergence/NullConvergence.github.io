## mtorch

[mtorch](https://github.com/NullConvergence/mtorch) is a Pytorch template for managing experiments.
It integrates well with many logging mechanisms and provides default abstractions for loading data, training and testing.

It is meant as a starting template for new Pytorch projects, where the boiler plate code for training and tested can be reused.
