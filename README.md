This website hosts a selection of open source projects I developed and maintained over time.

Some projects are still active, while others fly under the radar, but are still relevant.

### Previewing the website locally


1. Clone down the repository
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
5. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme
